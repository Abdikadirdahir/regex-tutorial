We'll take a quick look at what Regex "regular expressions" are and how they work in this tutorial. While regular expressions may appear intimidating at first appearance, they can be broken down into its most basic components and easily understood, much like any language.

-Summary 
A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of characters. From left to right, it is matched against a subject string. The pattern /abc/, for example, only matches character combinations in strings when the identical sequence "abc" appears.
